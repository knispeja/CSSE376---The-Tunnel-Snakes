  "body": "### Overview\r\nThe goal of this project was to implement and test a Stratego desktop application. Jacob Knispel, Alec Tiefenthal, and Logan Erexson worked on the original project and succeeded in implementing several additional features, such as a \"campaign\" mode and a working AI to play against.  \r\n\r\nLater, for a class on software design and refactoring, Jacob Knispel, Logan Erexson, Steven Trotta, and Jason Lane worked to refactor the code in order to greatly improve the design and allow room for additional functionality such as easy addition of new piece types and default boards. This team also added a \"kill feed\" which reports what pieces are killed in battle.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this refactoring broke the AI, which was bound closely to the design of the old system. Therefore, the AI remains functioning on the master branch, but the current version of the game on the CSSE375 branch has an AI which makes arbitrary decisions not based in strategy. The installer that can be downloaded from this page is for the version which lacks AI, as that version is more stable and contains fewer bugs.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJacob Knispel (@knispeja)  \r\nLogan Erexson (@LoganErexson)  \r\nAlec Tiefenthal (@Doomerdinger)  \r\nSteven Trotta (@Trottasn)  \r\nJason Lane (@Zetalight)\r\n",
